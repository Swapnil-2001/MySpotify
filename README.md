**Revisit your Spotify favorites, find new artists similar to the ones you love, explore top tracks by your favorite artists, find the latest songs you have listened to filtered by mood, all with MySpotify!** [Live demo](https://myspotify-aa2ed.web.app/) 

<br />

*All you need is a Spotify account, and you're good to go!* And the app is a **Progressive Web App**, which means you can also, if you want, install it into your mobile device or desktop.


I've used Redux for state management. The app is entirely client-side. It makes use of the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to access data. Hosting is done on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The design of the app was largely inspired by [Replayify](https://replayify.com/).

Is there some cool feature you'd like added? :star_struck: Or did you find a bug in the code somewhere? :grimacing: Or would you like to improve the file structure? :+1: Whatever it may be, don't hesitate to start a conversation. Feel free to open an issue. :innocent:

And do consider starring the repo if you like the project! :innocent:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
